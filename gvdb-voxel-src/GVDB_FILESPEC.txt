This file outlines the VBX file format specification.

File Format Versions
====================

 1.11 GVDB Release (3/25/2018)
      Versions on or after 1.11 save grid transforms to file.
      This allows save/load of volumes to render correctly in world space.

 1.1  GVDB Release (1/1/2018)
      Bitmask flags are optional. 
      Versions on or after 2.0 save setting to vbx file.

 1.0  GVDB Beta Release (10/2/2016)
      Grid data types:  Only 'f' (float)
      Grid components:  Only 1 
      Grid compression: Only 0 (none)
      Topology type:    Only 2 (gvdb)
      Brick layout:     Only 0 (atlas layout)
      
      
File Format

VBX HEADER
--------------
File Major Version #    1 byte
File Minor Version #    1 byte
Pre-translation         12 byte, vec3f \
XYZ Euler angles        12 byte, vec3f |[a]
Scale                   12 byte, vec3f |
Translation             12 byte, vec3f /
# of Grids              4 byte, int
Uses bitmasks           1 byte, bool    [b] Only present in GVDB 2.0+ VBX files
Grid offset 0           8 byte, ulong   [c]
Grid offset 1           8 byte, ulong
Grid offset ..          8 byte, ulong
Grid offset N           8 byte, ulong
  
  Note [a]: Only present in GVDB 1.11+ VBX files. GVDB applies
  pre-translation first, followed by scale, then rotation about
  the X, Y, and Z axes sequentially, followed finally by translation.
  
  Note [c]: The grid table is given as a list of file offsets
  to allow random access to grids without having to read
  the entire VBX file.

--------                TOPOLOGY SECTION

 P1 width               4 byte, int     [y] Width of Pool 1 for this level

--- TOPOLOGY POOLS
Topology data is stored next. 
If Topology Type = 0 then this section is omitted. This type is useful 
for general sparse brick storage without an explicit topology. With this type,
bricks must be stored in "brick layout" ordering.

If Topology Type = 1 then the topology is reused from another grid.
This type is useful when there are multiple channels of data, but all
having the same topology layout. In this case, the Reuse Grid value indicates the grid to be applied.

If Topology Type = 2 then the topology is a GVDB Structure, as follows.
Each pool for each level of the current grid is stored as a table.
The width of each pool is "P0/P1 Width", and the height (# rows) of the table is "Node cnt"
Pool 0 is the node pool, stored first. Each row contains a single node and bitmask.
Pool 1 is the child lists. Each row is a list of children IDs, with padding to the pool width.
The ordering of storage is pool, level, row:
  Pool 0, Level 0, Row 0..n
  Pool 0, Level 1, Row 0..n
  Pool 0, Level ., Row 0..n 
  Pool 0, Level L, Row 0..n    where L = # Levels 
  Pool 1, Level 0, Row 0..n
  Pool 1, Level 1, Row 0..n
  Pool 1, Level ., Row 0..n
  Pool 1, Level L, Row 0..n    where L = # Levels    

--------                ATLAS SECTION
Atlas (brick) data is stored next.

When the bricks are stored in "atlas layout", the data is stored
as a single, large, 3D volume with width-height-depth ordering.
Bricks are embedded inside the atlas, and cannot be easily read individually.
The stored size of each voxel in a brick matches the grid data type and number of components.
This layout is ideal for fast, efficient loading directly to the GPU.

When the bricks are stored in "brick layout", the data is stored
as data chunks for each brick, with width-height-depth ordering for each individual brick.
Bricks are written sequentially to the file.
This layout is ideal for out-of-core streaming, where individual bricks are delay loaded.
